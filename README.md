# What are the pros and cons of TDD?
Test Driven Development (TDD) involves writing test cases based on feature requests before developing code to pass those tests. Summarized below are the pros and cons:
  1) PROS:
     * More confidence at time of code deployment 
     * Better quality of code developed because testing processes are not rushed
     * Automates testing processes
     * More time efficient and effective than traditional testing techniques
     * Fits well with Agile
       
  2) CONS:
     * Passing tests may not always mean that the code is entirely correct
     * Slower development process as compared to traditional development
     * TDD is a skill and needs to be learnt and practiced, which may take up time for engineers who are used to traditional methods.
