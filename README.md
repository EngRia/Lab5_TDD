# What are the pros and cons of TDD? </br>
Test Driven Development (TDD) involves writing test cases based on feature requests before developing code to pass those tests. Summarized below are the pros and cons:
  1) PROS:
     * More confidence at time of code deployment 
     * Better quality of code developed because testing processes are not rushed
     * Automates testing processes
     * More time efficient and effective than traditional testing techniques
     * Fits well with Agile
       
  2) CONS:
     * Passing tests may not always mean that the code is entirely correct
     * Slower development process as compared to traditional development
     * TDD is a skill and needs to be learnt and practiced, which may take up time for engineers who are used to traditional methods.
